   ----Bash Word Guessing Game----

A simple terminal-based word guessing game written in Bash. The player tries to guess a randomly chosen word one letter at a time — similar to Hangman, but text-only.

   ----How It Works----
A random word is selected from a text file (oxford.txt)
The player sees only underscores representing each letter
They guess one letter at a time
The game reveals correct letters as they’re guessed
The game ends when the full word is correctly revealed
Pressing Enter with no input exits the game

   ----How to Run----
Run the code ./word_guess.sh on the command line
